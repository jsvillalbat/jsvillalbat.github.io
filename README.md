## Sevito Personal Portfolio â€” React + Vite

This repository contains my personal portfolio website. It showcases who I am, my skills, selected projects, and ways to get in touch. The app is built with React and Vite for a fast developer experience, and styled with Tailwind CSS. It includes a responsive layout, a theme toggle (light/dark), and simple navigation between sections.

### Tech stack
- **React** (with Fast Refresh)
- **Vite** tooling
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **React Router** for client-side navigation

## Local development setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or newer (Node 20 recommended)

Verify your versions:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

If the default port is in use, you can specify another:

```bash
npm run dev -- --port 5174
```

### Lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview the production build locally

This will start a local server (default `http://localhost:4173`) to preview the built site.
